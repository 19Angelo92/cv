    I'm currently working as a cocktail bartender for Hilton at Schiphol. I love my job because it allowes me to be creative and it gives me a lot of freedoom, but after working as bartender for more than 9 years I want something different, a new
    challenge....
    I studied Hotel management back in Spain, and I am very proud of it, the thing is that I don't feel that passion anymore so I started thinking about... what else can I do...? am I too late to change my carrer?... the answer is NO!
    I wanna challenge myself and try something completly different than what I'm doing, and I know that I'm capable enough to do anything I want, "where there is will, there is power" so is time to put that in parctise.
    So I'm starting a new and a completly different carrer as software developer. I know is going to be a difficult path but I'm going to put all my energy into it, so that one day I can make my family and myself very.. very proud!
