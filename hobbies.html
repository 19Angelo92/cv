    <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbl6PL3dgmE">Joga bonito</a></strong></li>
    <p>I've been playing football my whole life, always trying to be better and better, my only dream since I was little
      was to become a proffesional one day. So everyday and everywhere I went I will bring my football with me, even to the dentist
      or to help my mum with the groceries... I will drive her crazy haha</p>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ore2GcXFIv4">The art of mixology</a></strong></li>
    <p>I think my passion for misxing good drinks started in my garage. I used to invite my friends very often to my house
      and prepare sangria for everyone haha. My father taught me the basics of sangria and from there I started crafting my own </p>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSjjpL1gI1Y">Bouldering</a></strong></li>
    <p>This is a kind of sport that i never thougt I will like...pff climbing??? boooriing!! Well turns out, I love it! haha
    I don't know much about this sport but one thing is for sure, the more I go, the more I like it. </p>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf75I9LKhvg">cooking rice like a pro</a></strong></li>
    <p>Well I think is safe to say that any of my friends that had the pleasure to try my food can tell that I'm a good cook
    I love eating proper home cook meals. One of my favourite moments of the day is when I have a proper lunch with my lady Floor.</p>
